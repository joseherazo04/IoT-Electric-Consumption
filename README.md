# Real-Time Electricity Consumption Monitoring with Raspberry PI and Android App

# Abstract

In recent years, the issue of saving electricity has been gaining strength in the social sphere, since it is one of the many causes that influence the climate change we are experiencing. It is for this reason that this project proposes the development and implementation of a system that allows the user to measure the power consumption of their home in real time. Implementing the concept of the Internet of Things and Raspberry Pi technology, a device with the help of sensors will measure the current flow in real time, this data will be sent from the Raspberry Pi to a web platform, which will interprate the data for better understanding, in the same way, this data can be visualized in a mobile application that can be downloaded to the userâ€™s smartphone. The application will show the user, through graphs and tables, information of power consumption of their home, and how much money is costing in real time, this information can be used to give the user tips and recomendations on how to save energy and lower costs of electricity consumption.
